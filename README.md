This is a challenge from frontend mentor which I decided to tackle.While the challenge is meant to be for frontend practice, I wanted to make a full stack application and went with the MERN tech stack (MongoDb, Express, React, Node) in order to sharpen my skills for the backend portion of applications. Some of the libraries used are Redux, React-Router, MUI and using SCSS as I find myself enjoying the use of nesting my classes. I believe the backend is finished for the most part as I wanted to make sure I had my Routes and Controllers setup and ready to use when implementing the frontend. The way I approached this project was by checking the Figma files and thinking of potential cases where I'd have to make an api call and make models of the data I would need to request and/or send. I proceeded to make my backend and tested it out using the Insomia application. Once it was running I started with my frontend portion of the app. While it is not completed yet, I did want to upload it to github and update as I go.
